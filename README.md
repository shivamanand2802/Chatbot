# Chatbot

To create a simple chatbot using natural language processing (NLP), we use the 'nltk' library along with the 'nltk.chat' module. The 'nltk.chat' module provides a basic framework for creating chatbots. First, make sure to install 'nltk' by running 'pip install nltk' in your terminal.

This program defines a set of patterns and corresponding responses using the 'pairs' list. The 'Chat' object from 'nltk.chat' is used to process the user's input and generate responses.
